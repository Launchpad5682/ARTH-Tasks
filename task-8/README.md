# Task 8 


# How to contribute #
- Use : git clone https://github.com/Launchpad5682/ARTH-Tasks.git to initialize the repository in your local machine.
- Check that the repo is added as remote using : git remote -v 
- If not, add the repo as remote using : git remote add origin https://github.com/Launchpad5682/ARTH-Tasks.git
- Create a new branch as : git checkout -b branch_name
- Start adding changes to the code 
- When functional code is tested, stage and commit the changes using : git add . followed by git commit -m "Commit Message Here_" 
- Before pushing any changes through your username_mod branch, use : git pull --rebase origin main and then git push -u origin username_mod 
- Once done, create a pull request on the main branch, add concise PR message/description. 

### All final changes go into the main branch. ### 
Workflow: Changes in your feature branch (username_mod) will be rebased on top of the main branch. 
- All PRs will be merged with the main branch. 

## Do not use git push --force under any circumstances ##
## Do not make changes to your main branch. Always ensure that you're working on your mod branch using git branch or git branch --show-current ## 
## Do not push changes to your mod branch remote unless your previous PR is merged to avoid the commits from appearing in the open PR ##
